## Installation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Test Drive (No Risk)
1. Pick one of the 3 above
2. Download ISO
3. Create bootable USB ([guide here](../surface-pro-4/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md))
4. Boot from USB (doesn't touch Windows)
5. Use it for a day or two

### Phase 2: Dual-Boot (Low Risk)
1. Shrink Windows partition (50GB for Linux)
2. Install chosen distro alongside Windows
3. Choose OS at boot
4. Use Linux for a month, keep Windows as backup

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Committed)
1. Backup Windows files
2. Replace Windows with Linux
3. Enjoy life without forced updates

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I switch between these later?**
A: Yes, easily. Your /home folder (files) can be preserved.

**Q: What if I pick wrong?**
A: Try them all with live USB. No commitment needed.

**Q: Can I run Windows apps?**
A: Some (via Wine), but use native Linux alternatives when possible. See [terminology guide](./WINDOWS_SCHMINDOWS.md).

**Q: What about gaming?**
A: Mint/Zorin: 60-70% of Steam games work
Bazzite: 80-90% of Steam games work
Both: Anti-cheat multiplayer games mostly don't work

**Q: Will I need to use terminal?**
A: Mint/Zorin: Rarely or never
Bazzite: Occasionally (for gaming tweaks)

**Q: What about Microsoft Office?**
A: LibreOffice opens .docx/.xlsx files perfectly. Or use Office 365 web version.

## Final Recommendation

**If unsure, start with Linux Mint.**

It's the safest bet, has the largest community, and you can always switch to Zorin or Bazzite later if you want specific features.

**Process:**
1. Download Linux Mint ISO
2. Create bootable USB
3. Try it live (doesn't touch Windows)
4. If you like it, install alongside Windows (dual-boot)
5. Use for 1 month
6. If happy, remove Windows partition (reclaim space)

**Still unsure?** Try all 3 with live USB. Each boots from USB without installing.
