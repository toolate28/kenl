  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is EXCELLENT for Linux in 2025!
    Perfect for Windows 10 EOL migration.

    Why Surface Pro 4 + Linux is a great combination:
    1. ALL hardware works (Intel = perfect Linux support)
    2. Touch and pen work perfectly
    3. Better battery life than aging Windows 10
    4. Secure updates beyond October 2025
    5. Lighter OS = better performance on older hardware

    Ideal use cases:
    - Web browsing, email, office work
    - Note-taking with Surface Pen (Xournal++, Rnote)
    - Digital art (Krita, GIMP work great with pen)
    - Light gaming (indie games, older titles)
    - Media consumption (YouTube, Netflix)
    - Travel companion (thin, light, portable)

    NOT suitable for:
    - Modern AAA gaming (integrated graphics)
    - Heavy video editing (thermal throttling)
    - Virtual machines (limited RAM/CPU)
    - 4K video editing

    Recommended Linux setup:
    - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS + GNOME (best touch support)
    - OR Fedora 40 + GNOME
    - OR Bazzite (if light gaming is priority)

    Tips for best experience:
    1. Use GNOME (best touch/tablet mode)
    2. Enable TLP for better battery
    3. Use Flameshot for screenshots
    4. Install Xournal++ for note-taking
    5. Use Firefox with touch-optimized settings

    This device is PERFECT for students, travelers, and anyone
    needing a portable Linux tablet with excellent pen support.

    Windows 10 EOL is October 2025 - migrate to Linux NOW!
    Surface Pro 4 will run for another 3-5 years on Linux.
