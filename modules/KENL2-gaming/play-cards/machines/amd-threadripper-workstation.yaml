  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    The ultimate Linux workstation that also happens to be an incredible
    gaming machine. Threadripper + RDNA3 is the perfect combination.

    ALL AMD hardware = 100% open-source drivers = PERFECT Linux support.
    No proprietary driver hassles. Everything just works.

    Build cost breakdown (~$4500 USD):
    - CPU: $1500 (Threadripper 7960X)
    - GPU: $1000 (RX 7900 XTX)
    - RAM: $600 (128GB DDR5)
    - Storage: $800 (2TB PCIe 5.0 + 4TB PCIe 4.0 + 8TB RAID)
    - Motherboard: $700 (TRX50)
    - PSU: $250 (1200W Platinum)
    - Cooling: $300 (Custom loop)
    - Case: $200
    - Misc: $150

    Perfect for:
    - Professional 3D artists (Blender, Maya)
    - Video editors (DaVinci Resolve native on Linux!)
    - Software developers (fast compilation)
    - AI/ML researchers (run local LLMs)
    - Game developers (UE5, Unity)
    - 4K gaming at high refresh rates
    - Content creators who also game

    Workstation during the day, gaming beast at night.

    Why Threadripper for gaming?
    - Future-proof (games using more cores)
    - Run background tasks while gaming (streaming, recording, VMs)
    - Fast shader compilation
    - Excellent 1% low frame times (no stuttering)

    This machine will last 5-7 years without upgrades.
