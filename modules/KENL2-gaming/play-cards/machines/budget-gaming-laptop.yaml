    notes: |
      Budget gaming laptops work on Linux but have compromises:
      - NVIDIA Optimus causes battery drain and suspend issues
      - Must use X11 (Wayland unstable with NVIDIA)
      - Battery life is worse than Windows
      - Occasional resume issues

      However, gaming performance is good! Just be aware of the caveats.

  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Good budget gaming laptop for 1080p gaming on the go.
    RTX 4050 Mobile provides solid performance for the price.

    Typical models in this price range ($1300 AUD):
    - ASUS TUF A15 (Ryzen 5 7535HS + RTX 4050)
    - Lenovo LOQ 15 (Ryzen 5 7535HS + RTX 4050)
    - MSI GF63 Thin (similar specs)
    - Acer Nitro 5 (similar specs)

    Bazzite works well but has NVIDIA-related compromises:
    - Battery life is worse than Windows
    - Suspend/resume can be unreliable
    - Must use X11 (not Wayland)
    - NVIDIA Optimus causes issues

    Recommended settings for gaming:
    1. Plug in laptop (don't game on battery)
    2. Use Performance power profile
    3. Lower settings to Medium-High for 60+ FPS
    4. Consider external cooling pad

    Good for:
    - Casual gaming (1080p 60 FPS)
    - Esports (CS2, Valorant, LoL at 100+ FPS)
    - Older AAA games (high settings)
    - Indie games (max settings)
    - Productivity work

    Not ideal for:
    - Heavy AAA games (need Medium settings)
    - Ray tracing (too demanding)
    - 1440p gaming (performance suffers)
    - Long battery life (NVIDIA drains battery)

    Consider AMD-based laptop instead if:
    - Battery life is priority
    - Better Linux compatibility desired
    - Wayland support needed
    - Example: ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (full AMD)

    For the price, this is a solid 1080p gaming laptop that works
    reasonably well on Bazzite. Just be aware of NVIDIA limitations.
