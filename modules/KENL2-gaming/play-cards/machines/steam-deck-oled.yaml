  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Steam Deck OLED is the ULTIMATE portable Linux gaming device.
    The OLED model is a significant upgrade over the LCD model.

    OLED improvements vs LCD:
    - Brighter, more vivid display (1000 nits vs 400 nits)
    - 90Hz refresh rate (vs 60Hz)
    - Longer battery life (50Wh vs 40Wh)
    - Quieter fan
    - Better Wi-Fi (6E vs Wi-Fi 5)
    - Faster RAM (LPDDR5 vs LPDDR5)
    - Slightly lighter
    - Better haptics

    Perfect for:
    - Portable gaming (travel, commute, bed)
    - Indie games (6-8 hour battery)
    - Older AAA games (high settings, 40-60 FPS)
    - Recent AAA games (low-medium, 30-40 FPS)
    - Emulation (perfect for retro gaming)
    - Couch gaming (suspend/resume is incredible)

    Not ideal for:
    - Competitive FPS (800p, 90Hz limit)
    - Latest AAA at max settings (TDP limited)
    - Games with invasive anti-cheat
    - VR gaming

    Battery life examples:
    - Vampire Survivors: 8+ hours
    - Stardew Valley: 6-8 hours
    - Hollow Knight: 5-7 hours
    - Elden Ring (40 FPS): 3-4 hours
    - Cyberpunk 2077 (30 FPS Low): 2-3 hours

    Killer features:
    1. Instant suspend/resume (press power, game pauses instantly)
    2. Per-game settings (TDP, FPS limit, FSR)
    3. Proton compatibility (Windows games work!)
    4. Desktop mode (full KDE Plasma Linux desktop)
    5. Gyro controls (for aiming)
    6. Back buttons (customizable)
    7. Trackpads (for mouse in desktop mode)

    This is THE device for Linux gaming on the go.
    Works perfectly out of the box. No tweaking needed.

    If you want portable gaming + Linux, this is it.
