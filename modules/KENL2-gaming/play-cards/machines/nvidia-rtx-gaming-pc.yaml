  # Upgrade paths
  upgrade_recommendations:
    immediate:
      - component: "None"
        reason: "Well-balanced system"
    future:
      - component: "GPU"
        recommendation: "RTX 4070 / RX 7800 XT"
        reason: "Better 1440p RT performance"
        estimated_cost: "$500-600"
      - component: "CPU"
        recommendation: "Ryzen 7 5800X3D"
        reason: "More CPU headroom for 1% lows"
        estimated_cost: "$250-300"

  # Linux compatibility
  linux_compatibility:
    overall: "Excellent"
    nvidia_driver: "Requires proprietary driver (auto-installed on Bazzite)"
    suspend_resume: "Good (occasional issues)"
    power_management: "Good"
    hardware_video_decode: "Excellent (NVDEC/NVENC)"
    notes: |
      NVIDIA proprietary drivers work well on Bazzite (installed automatically).
      Wayland support is good but X11 is recommended for maximum compatibility.

      No hardware compatibility issues. All components work out of the box.

  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Excellent mid-high end gaming PC that handles 1440p gaming with ease.
    RTX 3070 provides great performance and ray tracing capabilities.

    Bazzite works perfectly with NVIDIA drivers (auto-installed on first boot).
    Recommend using X11 for maximum game compatibility, though Wayland works
    for most titles.

    Build cost breakdown (~$1300 USD):
    - CPU: $200 (Ryzen 5 5600X)
    - GPU: $500 (RTX 3070 - used market)
    - RAM: $80 (32GB DDR4)
    - Storage: $150 (1TB NVMe + 2TB SATA)
    - Motherboard: $140
    - PSU: $100
    - Cooling: $60
    - Case: $80

    Perfect for:
    - 1440p gaming at 60-144 FPS
    - Content creation (video editing, streaming)
    - Software development
    - VR gaming (Quest 2, Index, etc.)

    This is the "sweet spot" gaming PC for Bazzite in 2025.
