  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Hogwarts Legacy runs beautifully on Bazzite with GE-Proton 9-1.
    One of the best Proton experiences - near-native performance.

    Graphics are stunning and performance is excellent on recommended
    hardware. Game is well-optimized for Linux through Proton.

    Recommended settings for 1440p/60fps:
    - High preset (not Ultra - texture pop-in issues)
    - Ray tracing OFF (huge performance hit)
    - DLSS/FSR Quality mode (if available)
    - V-Sync ON or frame limiter at 60

    Hardware requirements:
    - Minimum: GTX 1070 / RX 5700, 8GB VRAM, 16GB RAM
    - Recommended: RTX 3070 / RX 6800, 8GB+ VRAM, 16GB RAM
    - Ultra/4K: RTX 4080 / RX 7900 XT, 12GB+ VRAM, 32GB RAM

    Performance tips:
    1. Use GE-Proton (much better than standard Proton)
    2. Disable ray tracing (not worth the performance cost)
    3. Set textures to High instead of Ultra
    4. Use FSR/DLSS if targeting 1440p or 4K
    5. Enable GameScope for better frame pacing

    Gameplay notes:
    - All quests completable
    - Achievements work
    - Controller support excellent (native Dualsense support)
    - Save system works flawlessly
    - No multiplayer/online features to test

    Known to work well on Steam Deck (30fps, Low-Medium settings).
