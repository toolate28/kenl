  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Minecraft Java Edition is NATIVE on Linux and runs perfectly on Bazzite.
    Performance is often BETTER than Windows due to native JVM.

    Installation options:
    1. Official Minecraft Launcher (recommended)
    2. PolyMC/Prism Launcher (better mod management)
    3. Flatpak: flathub.org/apps/com.mojang.Minecraft

    Performance is excellent on all hardware. Integrated graphics can
    run vanilla Minecraft at 60+ FPS on low settings.

    Recommended Java arguments (for launcher):
    -Xmx8G -Xms4G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
    -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20
    -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M

    Modding is EASY on Linux:
    - Use Fabric loader (better than Forge for performance)
    - Install Sodium + Iris + Lithium for massive performance boost
    - Use Modrinth for mod downloads (better than CurseForge)

    Tested configurations:
    - Vanilla: 200+ FPS on GTX 1060
    - Sodium + Shaders: 120+ FPS on RTX 3060
    - Heavy modpacks: 60+ FPS on RTX 3070

    Multiplayer:
    - All servers work perfectly
    - Realms work perfectly
    - LAN play works perfectly
    - Voice chat mods (Simple Voice Chat) work

    Steam Deck:
    - Runs great! 60 FPS vanilla, 40 FPS with shaders
    - Use on-screen keyboard for chat
    - Controller support via mods (Controllable, MidnightControls)

    This is one of the BEST gaming experiences on Linux.
    No compatibility layers needed - it's native!
