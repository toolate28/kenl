  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Battlefield 2042 runs well on Bazzite with GE-Proton 9-2.
    EA App works but requires X11 session (crashes on Wayland).

    Performance is good after shader compilation completes (first match
    may have stuttering). DXVK_ASYNC helps significantly.

    Multiplayer works flawlessly - no issues with matchmaking, parties,
    or voice chat. Cross-platform play with Windows/console works.

    Hardware requirements:
    - Minimum: GTX 1660 Super / RX 5600 XT, 16GB RAM
    - Recommended: RTX 3070 / RX 6700 XT, 16GB RAM
    - High settings require 8GB+ VRAM

    Known limitations:
    - Requires X11 (Wayland causes EA App crashes)
    - First match has shader compilation stutter
    - High CPU/GPU usage (demanding game)

    Tips for best performance:
    1. Use X11 session
    2. Enable DXVK_ASYNC
    3. Close background apps (game uses 12GB+ RAM)
    4. Let shaders compile in first match
    5. Use GE-Proton (better performance than standard Proton)
