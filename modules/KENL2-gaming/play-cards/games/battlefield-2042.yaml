      notes: |
        EA transitioned BF2042 to EA Javelin Anticheat in October 2023.
        This kernel-mode anti-cheat intentionally blocks Linux/Steam Deck.
        Game launches but kicks players before entering matches.
        No workaround exists - requires EA to enable Linux support.

  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    ⚠️ CRITICAL: Battlefield 2042 is UNPLAYABLE on Linux/Bazzite-DX ⚠️

    As of October 2023, EA replaced EasyAntiCheat with EA Javelin Anticheat,
    a proprietary kernel-mode anti-cheat that DOES NOT support Linux or
    Steam Deck. The game will launch via Proton but kicks players before
    entering matches with error codes (7)(2).

    THERE IS NO WORKAROUND. This is intentional blocking by EA.

    Historical Context (Pre-October 2023):
    - Game previously worked with EasyAntiCheat
    - Performance was good with GE-Proton 9-2
    - EA App required X11 session (crashed on Wayland)
    - Multiplayer, matchmaking, and cross-play worked

    Current Status:
    - Game launches but cannot enter matches
    - EA Javelin Anticheat error (7)(2) appears
    - No Linux/Steam Deck support planned by EA
    - All new EA multiplayer titles will use Javelin Anticheat

    Alternative Battlefield Titles for Linux:
    - Battlefield 1 (works with Proton)
    - Battlefield V (may work, check AreWeAntiCheatYet)
    - Older titles (BF3, BF4) via community servers

    Hardware requirements (if EA ever enables Linux support):
    - Minimum: GTX 1660 Super / RX 5600 XT, 16GB RAM
    - Recommended: RTX 3070 / RX 6700 XT, 16GB RAM
    - High settings require 8GB+ VRAM
