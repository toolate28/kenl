  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Elden Ring is one of the BEST Proton experiences on Linux.
    Native EasyAntiCheat support makes multiplayer flawless.

    Performance is excellent - locked 60 FPS on recommended hardware.
    Game is capped at 60 FPS by design (no unofficial mods on Linux).

    CRITICAL: Must use Proton GE or Experimental for EAC multiplayer.
    Standard Proton versions DO NOT support EasyAntiCheat.

    Hardware requirements:
    - Minimum: GTX 1060 6GB / RX 580 8GB, 12GB RAM
    - Recommended: RTX 3060 / RX 6600 XT, 16GB RAM
    - Maximum settings: RTX 3070 / RX 6700 XT, 16GB RAM

    Initial shader compilation:
    - First 20-30 minutes may have stuttering
    - Stutters will decrease as shaders compile
    - DXVK state cache persists between sessions
    - Subsequent playthroughs are smooth

    Multiplayer notes:
    - Co-op works perfectly (password and random summons)
    - PvP invasions work
    - Messages, bloodstains, ghosts all work
    - Cross-play with Windows/console players

    Performance tips:
    1. Use GE-Proton (required for multiplayer)
    2. Enable PROTON_USE_EAC_LINUX=1 (required for multiplayer)
    3. Maximum graphics settings on RTX 3060+ / RX 6700 XT+
    4. Let shaders compile (first 30 mins may stutter)
    5. Use GameScope for consistent frame pacing

    Controller support:
    - Native Dualsense support (haptics work!)
    - Xbox controllers work perfectly
    - Steam Input highly recommended
    - Keyboard + mouse supported but not ideal

    DLC compatibility:
    - Shadow of the Erdtree DLC works perfectly
    - No issues with DLC content or bosses
    - Same performance as base game

    Steam Deck:
    - Excellent! Stable 40 FPS on Medium settings
    - Use 40Hz refresh rate mode
    - Great handheld Souls experience

    Verified Deck Compatible - one of the best Deck games!
