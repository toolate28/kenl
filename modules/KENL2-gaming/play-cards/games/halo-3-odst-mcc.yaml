  # Additional notes
  notes: |
    Halo 3: ODST runs excellently on Bazzite with Proton Experimental.
    Native EasyAntiCheat support works flawlessly for multiplayer.

    Performance is excellent - locked 60 FPS on mid-range hardware.
    Campaign and Firefight modes are fully playable.

    Audio and visuals are identical to Windows version. No issues with
    saves, achievements, or cross-platform multiplayer.

    Recommended settings:
    - Proton Experimental (for EAC support)
    - V-Sync ON (prevents screen tearing)
    - Ultra settings for GTX 1060 6GB and above

    Works perfectly with GameScope for frame pacing and FSR upscaling.
