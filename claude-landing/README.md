# Claude Landing Zone

**Purpose:** Immediate orientation documents for any Claude instance (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) working on the KENL project.

## Quick Start

**First time here?** Read these in order:

1. **CURRENT-STATE.md** - Where we are right now (platform, branch, phase)
2. **RECENT-WORK.md** - What was just completed (last session's work)
3. **NEXT-STEPS.md** - Immediate actionable tasks
4. **HARDWARE.md** - Hardware specs and configuration
5. **QUICK-REFERENCE.md** - Common commands, paths, key files

## Supporting Documents

- **TESTING-RESULTS.md** - Recent validation results (network, modules, games)
- **MIGRATION-PLAN.md** - Windows → Bazzite migration roadmap

## Update Frequency

These documents should be updated:
- **After each major session** - Update RECENT-WORK.md and CURRENT-STATE.md
- **When state changes** - Branch changes, platform migrations, hardware updates
- **After testing** - Add results to TESTING-RESULTS.md
- **Before long breaks** - Ensure NEXT-STEPS.md is current

## ATOM Tracking

All documents in this directory use ATOM tags for traceability:
- Format: `ATOM-DOC-YYYYMMDD-NNN`
- See: `atom-sage-framework/README.md` for details
