# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead:

1. Email security@your-domain.example (replace with a real address) or use GitHub Security Advisories.
2. Provide a clear, reproducible description and steps to reproduce.
3. We will acknowledge within 48 hours and provide a remediation timeline.

We use automated scanning (CodeQL, Dependabot) and pre-commit secret detection.
